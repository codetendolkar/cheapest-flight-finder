    "In this assignment, we will devise a cheapest flight booking algorithm that beats the some of the worlds best flight booking sites. Specifically, we will find cheapest flights to NYC from various airports with layovers as time steps. A simgle time step optimization means direct flight. Two step means one layover in between. Three steps means 2 layovers in between and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our states will be airports and control will be choosing a specific airline to a specific airport. Therefore our state update function returns destination of the control chosen. The cost function returns cost of that flight. Note that cost function is additive. For example, if we decide to go BOM-LHR-NYC, the total cost = cost of BOM-LHR + cost of LHR-NYC. To see if our algorithm works, for cost function, we will use actual flight prices for 13th January 2018 from KAYAK website."
