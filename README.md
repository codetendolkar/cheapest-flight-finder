Assignments created as a Teaching Assistant for Machine Learning course at OSU.

Example:
Cheapest BOM to NYC on flights for a particular date displayed by kayak.com are as follows -

The cheapest flight calculated by the algorithm for BOM-NYC for the same date is $990 as one-hop BOM-LHR-NYC. You can see the corresponding flights in above images
